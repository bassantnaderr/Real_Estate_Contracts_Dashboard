# **Contracts Team Dashboard**  

## **Project Overview**  
This dashboard was developed for the Contracts Team to **analyze and track contracts progress** across different stages. It provides visibility into Prime contracts, Annex contracts, handovers, and the overall contracts cycle. The tool was designed in Power BI with **interactive buttons** for smooth navigation across six main views.  

> All sensitive project data (such as project names) has been anonymized for portfolio purposes.  

## **Dashboard Features**  
- **Interactive Navigation** – Users can switch between six views with a single click.  
- **Contracts Tracking** – Covers Prime and Annex contracts from initiation to handover.  
- **Time Analysis** – Average durations for handover, approval, and completion.  
- **Annex Insights** – Breakdowns by type (maintenance, resale, reschedule, parking, etc.).  
- **Cycle Monitoring** – Full visibility into the contracts lifecycle, from initiation to client delivery.
